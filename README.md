###### HW Handout:
1. A singly-linked list contains nodes that only have pointers to the next node, but not to the previous node. See SinglyLinkedList.java for a partial implementation. Complete the function remove_last(element). This function takes as argument an element, and removes the last instance of that element from the list. 

   For example, if the list was 8 7 8 1 9 5 3, after calling remove_last(8) the list would become 8 7 1 9 5 3. 

   The list remains the same if the element is not in the list. Partial credit will be given for comments that suggest the correct approach, even if the code is buggy.
